This code only works when openned in Phaser launcher or on a webserver/host.

There are 10 microgames and they are all created with balance as a theme but with different interpretations.
Every microgame will increase in difficulty at every 10 levels until the max difficulty at level 40.
The only goal is to reach the highest level you can. Maybe try to complete every microgame at it's highest difficulty.
The only controls that work are cursor/arrow keys and the spacebar. The spacebar is used to lock in your answer for most microgames.

Microgames
 - Balance Sheet: Self explanatory if you've ever filled in a balance sheet. Just fill in the missing entry. If you've never done a balance sheet I don't know how to explain this one to you.
 - Blocks: There are two scales. The left one has blocks with labelled weight while the right one has unlabelled blocks. The left scale does not show the total weight while the right one does. You need to pick the block that will make the scales equal weight.
 - Dots: You need to pick the side with less black squares.
 - A Normal Day: The guy will go through good and bad events. You need to choose whether a good or bad event should happen to them so an equal amount of good and bad has happened to them.
 - Ones and Zeroes: +1s, -1s, and 0s approach a box. You need to figure out how much the box increased or decreased by and then choose the appropriate amount to add or subtract to make it equal zero.
 - Sculpting: Memorize the right sculpture and copy it.
 - Seesaw: Pick the option with an equal amount of squares as the one on the right side of the seesaw.
 - Strength Puzzle: Copy the right side. Both the boulders and player character need to be in the same positions. Don't forget to use space to confirm your answer.
 - Tightrope: Just follow the arrows.
 - Waves: Make both sides symmetrical by changing the length of the left rectangles. Don't forget to use space to confirm your answer.
