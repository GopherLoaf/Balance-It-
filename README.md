This code only works when openned in Phaser launcher or on a webserver/host.

There are 10 microgames and they are all created with balance as a theme but with different interpretations.
Every microgame will increase in difficulty at every 10 levels until the max difficulty at level 40.
The only goal is to reach the highest level you can. Maybe try to complete every microgame at it's highest difficulty.
The only controls that work are cursor/arrow keys and the spacebar. The spacebar is used to lock in your answer for most microgames.
